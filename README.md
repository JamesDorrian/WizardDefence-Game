# WizardDefence-Game
A game created with game maker studio. Implements start and pause menus, enemy AI, fireballs, obstacles, mutations, scoring and intuitive user controls

The game was created to understand the fundamentals of game development. The language seen in allcode.txt is GML (Game Maker Language). I found this langauge to be extremely intuitive and robust.
